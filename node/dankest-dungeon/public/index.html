            <h1>Dankest Dungeon 1.0</h1>

            <p style="font-size: 14pt">Dismayed by the state of politics in the land of Yonder, you decided to research political
                science. With no source material available beyond the sacred texts of <i>Vulpes Nuntium</i>,
                you conclude that only the dankest of memes can be used to win back sanity in your lands. Since
                dank things are generally found underground, you set forth into the <i>Dankest Dungeon</i>,
                seeking to find the <i>Amulet of Winning</i> - and restore political sanity to the land.
            </p>

                This is a 7-Day Roguelike, created as an exercise in finding out what <a href="https://github.com/kripken/emscripten">Emscripten</a>
                can do these days. Please enjoy it, and provide feedback to /u/thebracket on Reddit. This program is
                provided as-is. No warranty, express or implied, is provided. Any resemblance to real-life characters
                is purely coincidental. In other words - have fun, please don't sue me, and remember that this was

            <h2>Brave Adventurer - Identify Yourself!</h2>
            <p>This game is built around designing dungeons, and sharing them with other adventurers. As such, you
                need a user account - so we know which dungeons are yours. Very little effort has been put into
                security, so please don't use a password that you care about, or use for anything important!
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also login as <strong>guest</strong> with the password <strong>guest</strong> if you
                feel uncomfortable with logins. This will prevent you from being attributed for any levels
                you create, but otherwise has full access.
